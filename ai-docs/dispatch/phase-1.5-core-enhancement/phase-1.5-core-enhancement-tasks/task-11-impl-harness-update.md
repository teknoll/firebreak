## Objective

Updates the harness patterns analysis document to reference Phase 1.5 as the implementation of its actionable recommendations.

## Context

The harness patterns analysis at `ai-docs/dispatch/harness-patterns-analysis.md` contains recommendations that Phase 1.5 implements: test reviewer criteria enhancement, spec template user verification steps, breakdown interface contracts, task reviewer gate flexibility, and inter-wave verification. The document should be updated to reflect that these recommendations are now implemented, with cross-references to the specific context assets that were modified.

## Instructions

1. In each "Actionable improvements" subsection that Phase 1.5 addresses, add an implementation status note:
   - Recommendation 1 (Agent-side startup verification) → "Implemented in Phase 1.5: per-task readiness check in implementation-guide.md and codebase-grounded compilation in task-compilation.md"
   - Recommendation 3 (Explicit test granularity guidance) → "Implemented in Phase 1.5: two-tier test reviewer enforcement model in test-reviewer.md, user verification steps and integration seam declarations in feature-spec-guide.md"
   - Recommendation 4 (Verify before you build) → "Implemented in Phase 1.5: inter-wave baseline-snapshot regression check in implementation-guide.md"
   - Recommendation 5 (Premature completion) → "Implemented in Phase 1.5: Tier 2 behavioral completeness 'show your work' requirement in test-reviewer.md"

2. In the "Bug-fix workflow pattern" section, add a note that the corrective workflow has been formalized in `home/.claude/docs/sdl-workflow/corrective-workflow.md`.

3. In the "Improvement findings from this cycle" subsection, add status notes for each finding that Phase 1.5 addresses: test reviewer criteria, e2e coverage depth, ceremony level matching, gate flexibility.

4. Do not change the analytical content — only add implementation status cross-references.

## Files to create/modify

Modify:
- `ai-docs/dispatch/harness-patterns-analysis.md`

## Test requirements

Structural review: verify cross-references are present and accurate.

## Acceptance criteria

All ACs: The harness analysis document traces each recommendation to its Phase 1.5 implementation.
